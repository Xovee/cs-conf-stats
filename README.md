## If You Know

If you know some stats of the conferences [listed here](./If-You-Know.md), you can send them to us. 

## Need Check

[Some events](./Need-Check.md) need further check (e.g., when proceedings are published). 

## CSS Compile

Using `tailwindcss` and `npm`:
```shell
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o output.css --watch
```

## Discuss

Should I include second-tier conferences? If you have some thoughts, you can share with me :)
